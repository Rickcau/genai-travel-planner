This repo contains several examples of which I will list below.

## ConsoleApp-BagOfWords
This console app demostrats the Bag Of Words concept.

The code provided uses the FeaturizeText transformation in ML.NET to convert text data into numerical feature vectors. This transformation creates a Bag-of-Words (BoW) representation of the text, which is a common technique in natural language processing (NLP).

## ConsoleApp-Chat-Streaming
This is a simple console app that demostrates streaming data from an ASP.NET Core REST API. You might think this is super simple but it's not. ASP.NET can actaully cause the data to be buffered or converted to a string array, even when using IAsyncEnumerable.
